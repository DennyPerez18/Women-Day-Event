To add a new event, create a pull request modifying the README with the template bellow, filled with your event information:

```md
- [<EVENT-NAME>](<LINK-OR-WEBSITE>)
> Date: <DATE-ISO-FORMAT> | Languages: <COMMA-SEPARATED-VALUES> | Format: <In-Person|Online> | Location: <ADDRESS>

<OPTIONAL-SHORT-DESCRIPTION>
```

Using `PyCon US 2024`, it would end up looking like:

```md
- [PyCon US 2024](https://us.pycon.org/2024)
> Date: 2024-05-15 | Languages: English | Format: In-Person, Online | Location: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvalnia

PyCon US attracts a unique audience of Python users and community members, from beginners just learning the language to the leading developers in the field to community organizers to the contributors who guide the development of the language itself.
```
